My First Assembly Language Project<br>
ðŸŽ® Snake Game â€“ x86 Assembly Language (BIOS Interrupts)
My Contributions:

Designed and coded the game space box using low-level graphics logic.

Implemented snake movement using keyboard interrupt-driven controls.

Built the core game loop and logic, including collision detection and basic score control.

Worked directly with BIOS interrupts and memory registers, focusing on optimizing runtime flow in a low-level environment.

This project was a deep dive into systems programming and performance-focused design using pure assembly â€” no libraries used.
